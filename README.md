# KtorEasy
**[Work in Progress] ðŸš§ ðŸš§ This README FILE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION** ðŸš§ ðŸš§<br>
This is a project to demonstrate a suggested Ktor architecture. It includes Backend implementation with Ktor, MariaDB database connection with Hikari, Docker command to build Backend container and Docker compose to run both database and backend instance.

## Architecture explained
![arch_image](https://github.com/mathias21/KtorEasy/blob/master/ktorArch.png?raw=true)<br>
This is a suggested architecture that pretends to follow CLEAN principles. The main idea behind it is to define each layer with one purpose and to allow unit testing each layer independently.

To achieve this, I'm using Koin as a dependency injection framework.

### Application.kt
File to define Java app main method, Koin setup and configuration initialisation.

### Module.kt
Application extension function where we configure Ktor application with features, interceptors and routing.

### Modules
Each module will define routes related with its functionality. It will be a Route function extension to configure it and it will receive an injected controller object. This layer is responsible of reacting to API call, receive parameters and invoke controllers function with them.

### Controllers
There will be one controller per module and it will receive by injection those API objects it will use to handle module requests. Here all the business logic should be defined. Controller will fetch/write data through API objects and unhappy paths will be handled throwing exceptions and answered by status pages.

### APIs
This layer will use DAOs to recover/write information from/in database. It will be responsible of transforming data if needed.

### DAOs
DAOs objects will define tables and those operations to do with them. It will also map table rows into API expected objects. 

## How to run it
This project it is prepared to be run in Docker. With just two simple commands you will have it deployed to Docker with MariaDB container linked to the backend instance. Following these steps will do the magic:

1. Run **buildContainer.sh** file to create Backend Docker container image.
2. Once this is done, run **docker-compose.yml** file.
